## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.
Yes.
### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  Bondly is an interoperable, transparent, and portable swap protocol designed to revolutionize traditional escrow methods and make everyone into their own digital marketplace.
  Our family of trust-enabling DeFi products are designed to be a part of everyday buying and selling activities, giving peace of mind for swap or online purchases. 
  Our product BProtect is a DeFi enabled eCommerce gateway specializing in integrating into your favorite online marketplaces very simply and easily with no integration fees, just staking tokens.
  Bondly conducted its NFT sale via opensea and Rarible (two open marketplaces at current status quo). Opensea and rarible are very similar to p2p marketplaces today like amazon. 
  Similar to the rampant counterfeit problem of amazon, Opensea and Rarible suffer from a host of unauthenticated ripoff content which is very hard to verify for people just getting on-boarded into the NFT space. 
  We witnessed this first hand with our well-intentioned buyers finding difficulty buying the authentic cards. Without a strong intent, that indicates a high-risk of churn and losing a sale as a merchant.
  Now, strong intent can be cultivated / grown over time by brands and merchants with a passionate following and instead of competing in a noisy environment of OpenSea / rarible - merchants have the clout to draw passionate customers onto their own dedicated destinations instead (merchant storefronts) where customers can directly buy from the merchant without leaving their branded experience, they are ensured a superior checkout UX and can confirm the authenticity of their purchases.
  Bondly platform enables an out of the box elegant solution for the merchants (brands, individuals, projects etc) to spin up their own branded storefronts in a few clicks. 

  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  We will have an alternate version of our apps built natively in Substrate along with hosting our Solidity based apps on an existing parachain using Frontier EVM. 
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  We saw a need to solve the issue of OTC trading and to be able to trustlessly purchase digital goods through the creation of decentralized financial (DeFi) applications powered by a cross-chain swap architecture and novel token-powered escrow platform.
### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components

* API specifications of the core functionality
N/A
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
Angular / TypeScript, Rust, MongoDB, Amazon Lambda
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1helk5TOPe_ccVOQL5Qy-4d54UyMFmv7niGrgMzFY204/edit?ts=5fa6c53b#heading=h.115moiwqne9x 
Please see tiny.cc/bondpaper for the business level design.
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
 See Figma above

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
Airswap and Bounce Finance.Our differentiating factor is that we are a smart contract based marketplace payment platform designed to make the buying and selling of any good or service easy and protected. 
Bondly offers a more robust set of capabilities that include escrow, recurring payments, and payment protection.
Platform Differentiators:
-Cross chain NFT trading using NFT assets published on specialty NFT blockchains like Flow (Dapper Labs) and Hive (Splinterlands)
-The ability to use fungible assets from any blockchain to make payment including legacy POW (BTC,LTC, ETC, BCH, etc) (x chain bridge to use : Ren and Darwinia, xchain AMM : mooniswap)
-Anti fraud capabilities to verify vendors using staking and more sophisticated validation methods; fighting fraud and direct duplication ; making bondly staking requirements mandatory for verification and taking their stake if they are proven to violate copyright 
-Ability to publish NFT assets and NFT contracts with no technical background, similar to Rarible and Cargo.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

### Overview
Total Estimated Duration:** June 2021
Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  5 
Total Costs:** $90k

### Milestone 1 - Finalize Figma Prototype
Estimated Duration:** 1 month
FTE:**  1
Costs:** $5,000

### Milestone 2 - Develop the UI part for the MVP
Estimated Duration:** 1 month
FTE:**  2
Costs:** $40,000

### Milestone 3 - Port smart contract layer on Substrate EVM Pallet
